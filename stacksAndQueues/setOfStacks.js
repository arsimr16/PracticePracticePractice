// imagine a literal stack of plates. If the stack gets too high, it might topple.
// Therefore in real life we would likely start a new stack when the previous stack
// exceeds some threshold.  

// implement a data structure SetOfStacks that mimics this.  It should be composed of
// several stacks and should create a new stack when the previous one exceeds capacity
// push and pop should behave identically to the methods of for a single stack

// FOLLOW UP:
// implement a popAt(index) method which performs a pop operation on a specific sub-stack
