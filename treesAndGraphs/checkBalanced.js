// implement a function to check whether a binary tree is balanced
// a balanced tree is defined to be a tree such that the heights
// of the two subtrees of any node never differ by more than 1

// I: a binary search tree
// O: a boolean - whether or not the BST is balanced (see def. above)
// C: none
// E: an empty tree is balanced
const isBalanced = (BST) => {

};
// time complexity:
// space complexity:
